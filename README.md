### Porpose
The idea behind this project is spread the knowledge which I've learnt in the last few days. I'd created a challenge for me and that was the result. The project consist in build a metodology of development with angularjs, in which one I could notice how much faster can be develop web projects with SPA (*Single Page Application*), especially with angularjs.
